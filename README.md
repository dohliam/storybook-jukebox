# Storybook Jukebox - A media player for multilingual storybooks

## Overview

The Storybook Jukebox plays text, images, and audio of translated stories from the [Global ASP](https://github.com/global-asp/global-asp) collection. The stories play automatically, reading through each page in sequence. This is a counterpart to the existing [audio slideshows](https://global-asp.github.io/audio), which are user-controlled and play one page at a time. Unlike the audio slideshows, the Storybook Jukebox requires no user interaction.

## Controls

Story audio plays automatically. Click anywhere on the text to toggle translation. There are also shortcut keys to allow control of playback using the keyboard.

### Shortcut keys

There are a number of shortcut keys available to access the media controls:

* **Play/Pause**: _Shortcut modifier key + p_
* **Stop**: _Shortcut modifier key + x_
* **Previous chapter**: _Shortcut modifier key + h_
* **Previous story**: _Shortcut modifier key + j_
* **Next chapter**: _Shortcut modifier key + k_
* **Next story**: _Shortcut modifier key + l_
* **Show help**: _Shortcut modifier key + ?_
